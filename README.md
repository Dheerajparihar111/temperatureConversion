🌡️ Temperature Conversion (Java)
📌 Project Description

Temperature Conversion is a Java-based project that provides accurate and efficient conversion between the three most widely used temperature scales: Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K).
This repository is designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, making it ideal for beginners as well as anyone looking for a reliable reference for temperature conversion logic in Java.

The project includes all possible conversions among these temperature units, ensuring completeness and practical usability.

🔁 Available Conversions

This project supports the following six temperature conversions:

Celsius ➝ Fahrenheit

Fahrenheit ➝ Celsius

Celsius ➝ Kelvin
